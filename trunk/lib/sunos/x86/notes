notes: Using ncurses on both Solaris and Nexenta took some work;
* There is an terminfo directory in /usr/share/terminfo and in /usr/share/lib/terminfo. The first doesn't work in Nexenta's normal terminal(outside X), while the second does not give colors in X. So when X is running the first is choses, otherwise the second will be used(the startup script will set $TERMINFO). Note that the 'normal' solaris will work with both.
* Regular Solaris use 'sun-color' as the default terminal(outside X). I couldn't get this get to work with ncurses. Therefore when 'sun-color' is detected (and it's not Nexenta which is running) the $TERM variabele is set(temporary) to 'sun' instead. The drawback is that it has no color support. On Nexenta 'sun-color' works however.

If you know better ways or have fixes please email me.
