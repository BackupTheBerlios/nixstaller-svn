0.5 -->
- Fixed: MKDirRec failed on "."'s
- Fixed: File copying didn't work on symlinks
- Command execution (normal, not root) is now done via pseudo terminals instead of pipes (makes things more repsonsive)
- Fixed: Number conversion verifier function handled minimum values from floating types incorrect.
