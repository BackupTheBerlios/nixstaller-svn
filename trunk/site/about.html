  <title>About Nixstaller</title>
</head>

The project 'nixstaller' is about providing a way to easily create user friendly installers for unix content(mainly software) on unix like systems(currently only Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD).<br>

<p> <h2>Features</h2>
Here is a list of most of the features Nixstaller currently has:

<h3>Supported Operating Systems</h3>
Currently Nixstaller is tested on the following systems:<br>
<br>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>OS</th>
      <th>Arch</th>
      <th>Version(s)</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NetBSD</td>
      <td>x86</td>
      <td>1.6.2, 2.02, 3.0</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FreeBSD</td>
      <td>x86</td>
      <td>5.3, 6.0</td>
      <td>FreeBSD 4.X doesn't work yet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Linux</td>
      <td>x86</td>
      <td>Kubuntu Breezy, Gentoo, Knoppix 3.3-2003-11-19</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Since almost anything is staticly liked it's very lickely that similar systems work aswell.<br>
Please contact me if you want to help me with porting to another architecture/OS.<br>
<br>

<h3>Frontends</h3>
The frontends are simply programs which the user will get to see when they run the installer. Currently there are 2 graphical frontends used for the installer: the first is using <A href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</A> and the second <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</A> via
<A href="http://invisible-island.net/cdk/">CDK</A><br>
Qt and GTK2 frontends are planned for next versions.<br>
<br>
Each frontend has the following features:
<ul>
   <li>Can be translated(no UTF yet). Dutch and english translations are supplied by default</li>
   <li>Screen where the user can choose the language</li>
   <li>Optional intro screen with customizable image and text</li>
   <li>Optional screen where a user have to accept a license agreement</li>
   <li>Optional screen where the user has to select a destination directory</li>
   <li>Optional screen where the user can set parameters used by installation commands</li>
   <li>Installation progress screen</li>
   <li>Optional screen which appears when the installation is done</li>
</ul>
<br>

Most of the required libs for the frontends are linked staticly, so users of the installer don't have to worry about any dependencies.<br>
<br>

<p> <h2>Configuration</h2>
Ofcourse can nixstaller be configured;
<ul>
   <li> Can use either gzip or bzip2 to compress the files </li>
   <li> You can specify which frontends you want to be included </li>
   <li> A way to specify which frontends for which Operating Systems should be included </li>
   <li> Extraction directory can be specified: Specified by the user, to a default directory(ie for binaries), temporary(ie for compiling the package) </li>
   <li> A way to specify any shell commands that will be executed after the files are extracted. You can also specify the used parameters for each command(ie --prefix for './configure') so that the user can configure them before the installation begins. This feature is especially handy for compiling a package on the user's system. </li>
 </ul>

<p> <h2>How it works</h2>
When creating the installer a self extractable archive will be created (powered by
<A href="http://www.megastep.org/makeself/">makeself</A>). The only thing the user has to do is running this script, it then will do:
<ul>
   <li> Extract some required files for the graphical frontends(configuration file, translations, archive containing the files to be installed(this is not extracted before installation) etc). Default the files will go in a subdirectory on /tmp.  </li>
   <li> Search for the right frontend(depending on which are included, if X is running etc). </li>
   <li> Launch this frontend. </li>
   <li> Clean the files used by the installer. </li>
 </ul>


<p> <h2>Requirements</h2>
<p> <h3>The end user</h3>
Additional libraries used by the frontends(such as ncurses, X etc) are all linked staticly. Some system libraries(libm, libc) are kept dynamic, since some functions need runtime support and these libraries don't change that often anyway.<br>
This simply means that the end user hardly needs to worry about any dependencies.<br>
Note that it's possible to supply different binaries for different OS'es/architectures/libc's.<br>
<br>

<p> <h3>The install creator</h3>
The same as the end user. All supported frontends are precompiled in the nixstaller package.<br>
The scripts use plain SH, which should be available by default.<br>
<br>

<p> <h3>People who want to compile nixstaller</h3>
If you want to build you will need atleast SCons version 0.96.91 (which needs python) and incase you want to build the required libraries you need those aswell. The {manual} has a section about compiling Nixstaller and where to get all the required libraries.<br>
