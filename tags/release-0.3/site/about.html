  <title>About Nixstaller</title>
</head>

Nixstaller is an Open Source project with the goal to create user friendly and flexible installers that work on various UNIX like systems.<br>
<br>

<h3>Main Features</h3>
<br>
<ul>
   <li> Three different installer frontends, powered by GTK+2, FLTK and ncurses.</li>
   <li> Support for many common UNIX like systems (see table below) </li>
   <li> Can be fully translated (English and Dutch translations are already provided) </li>
   <li> The installation files can be compressed with lzma, gzip and bzip2. </li>
   <li> The installation files that should be used can depend on the current system. </li>
   <li> <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> support is provided to configure the installer and to program the installation procedure. This allows very flexible configurations. </li>
   <li> Very few dependencies: the end user and install creator only needs one of the supported systems. For compilation <A href="http://www.scons.org">SCons</A> (and python) is also required. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation Screens</h3>
<br>
Each installer has a set of installation screens. There are various types:
<ul>
    <li> A screen where the user can select a language. </li>
    <li> An introduction screen with an optional image and text. </li>
    <li> A screen where the user can read/accept a provided license. </li>
    <li> A screen where the user can select a destination directory to put the installation files. </li>
    <li> A screen which shows the progress of the installation. </li>
    <li> A screen which can show text after the installation. </li>
    <li> Custom made screens which can be made via Lua scripting (see below). </li>
</ul>
All the screens are optional and the order when to display them is also configurable.<br>

<br>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<br>
Nixstaller uses the <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> scripting language.

<br>

Firstly lua is used to configure some settings, such as
<ul>
   <li> Which translations should be included. </li>
   <li> Which compression format should be used to compress the installation files. </li>
   <li> Which frontends to include. </li>
   <li> When and which installation screens should be displayed. </li>
 </ul>

<br>

Besides configuration Lua is also used to program the installer. Some examples for this are:
<ul>
   <li> Create new installation screens </li>
   <li> Extract the installation files to a directory that is specified specified by the script or user. </li>
   <li> Communicate with the users system through various Lua library functions </li>
   <li> Execute various shell commands (ie to compile). </li>
 </ul>

<br>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<br>
Briefly said Nixstaller works like this:
<ul>
   <li> A script is called that creates a basic project directory. This directory contains several configuration files and the files that should be installed. </li>
   <li> A script is called that scans the project directory and creates the installer. The installer is a shell script with an embedded archive containing everything it needs. This script is made with <A href="http://www.megastep.org/makeself/">makeself</A>. </li>
   <li> When a user executes this script the embedded archive will be extracted to a temporary directory. </li>
   <li> Another script is then called which will launch the right frontend for the users system. This depends on various things such as the operating system and if a X server is running. </li>
   <li> The frontend guides the user through the installation; the user can configure various settings, read important text messages and follow the installation process. </li>
   <li> After the installation is finished the temporary directory is removed. </li>
 </ul>

This is all discussed in detail in the <A href="http://nixstaller.berlios.de/manual/0.3/nixstaller.html">user manual</A>.
