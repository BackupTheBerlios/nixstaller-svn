What Is Vim?

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version
of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.
Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider
it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing,
from composing email to editing configuration files.
