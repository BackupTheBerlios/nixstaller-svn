Notes for solaris libs:

Host system: x86 OpenSolaris 2008.11

For library versions and build options see builddeps.sh.

In order to make everything work on Solaris 10 librt has linked to be linked for nanosleep(). Also libXft must be
linked static with a version not coming from Solaris 10, as that version segfaults with FLTK. The first is done automatically in SConstruct
and libXft can be build via builddeps.sh.
