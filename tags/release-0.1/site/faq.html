<p> <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<hr>
<br><br>

<p> <h2>What is this all about?</h2>
With Nixstaller you can easily create installers for your Linux/Unix content(software). It is as simple as putting some files in a folder, modify a small config file and run a script.<br>
<br>

<p> <h2>Why Nixstaller?</h2>
Basically if your package is not available from the package manager you use(if your system even has one) the installation can be tricky for some users. Nixstaller tries to make it easier for the end user to install a package and for the developer to create a package.<br>
<br>
<p> <h2>What platforms does it run on?</h2>
Currently on x86(i486, Intel compatible) on the following Operating Systems: Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.<br>
<br>
<p> <h2>What does it install?</h2>
Currently Nixstaller will extract all the files in a temporary directory, from there it can run shell commands which are specified in a configuration file. That way it can install all kinds of things. Some examples: Simple things like games(just extract) or a package which needs to be compiled on the users system.<br>
<br>
<p> <h2>What do I need in able to use it?</h2>
As a user or as a install creator: nothing but a supported *nix platform.<br>
If you want to compile Nixstaller you should read the <A href="http://nixstaller.berlios.de/viewpage.php?page_id=3#compile">Compile section in the manual</A>.<br>
<br>
<p> <h2>And when do I want to compile?</h2>
Generally only when you want to make support for another platform or when you made modifications to the source.<br>
