<h3>What is Nixstaller?</h3>
With Nixstaller you can create installers for various UNIX like systems. More details at the <A href="http://nixstaller.berlios.de/about">about page</A>.

<h3>Why Nixstaller?</h3>
On most UNIX systems a package manager is used for software installation. If the software you want is not available as a package for your system installation can be tricky. With Nixstaller an installer can be made that will ease the installation process. It also works on many different systems.

<h3>What can be installed?</h3>
Many kinds of installation procedures can be programmed thanks to the <A href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</A> scripting language. Some examples:
<ul>
   <li> An installer that extract files to a directory specified by the user. </li>
   <li> An installer that extracts files to a temporary directory, compiles several binaries and then install these binaries and several other files to the users system. </li>
 </ul>

<h3>What software license does Nixstaller use?</h3>
Nixstaller is released under the terms of GPLv2. Note that this doesn't affect the content used by generated installers. In other words: if you want to modify Nixstaller you have to obey the rules of the GPLv2 license but you can create installers that install files under any software license.
