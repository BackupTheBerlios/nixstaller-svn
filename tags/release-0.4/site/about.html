  <title>About Nixstaller</title>
</head>

Nixstaller is an Open Source project with the goal to create user friendly and flexible installers that work on various UNIX like systems.<br>
<br>
<h3>Project Goals</h3>
Nixstaller is created with the following goals in mind:
<ul>
<li>Work on various UNIX like systems. Ideally as much as possible.</li>
<li>Be fully translatable.</li>
<li>Small 'size overhead', meaning that installer packages should not be much bigger than a regular compressed (tar) archive would be.</li>
<li>Run on recent and less recent operating systems.</li>
<li>Very few dependencies, especially for the end user.</li>
<li>Support different frontends, to make sure that the installer will run on as much possible systems and possible have a native look.</li>
<li>Make the creation of installers both easy and flexible.</li>
<li>Installed software from Nixstaller should ideally be managed by the user's package manager, if not possible scripts will be provided.</li>
<li>Dependency handling (this needs further research, possibly heading to 'self containing' packages).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Features</h3>
Most of the goals are already implemented, though in future releases many of them will be furtherly extended.

<h4>Supported Systems</h4>
Nixstaller runs on many different systems, the table below lists those which are currently supported.

<h4>Translations</h4>
Nixstaller can be fully translated (including any text coming from scripts). At the moment however there is no good support for character encoding, meaning that things as UTF-8 may not work yet.

<h4>Frontends</h4>
Frontends are used to communicate with the end user. The frontends will let the user control and view the installation process. Because not every system is the same, Nixstaller comes with three different frontends:

<ul>
<li>The ncurses frontend is a text based frontend. It should run on almost any system.</li>
<li>The FLTK frontend is a graphic frontend using X11. Because it's linked staticly it runs on almost every system which has X11 running.</li>
<li>The GTK+2 frontend is also a graphic frontend, but will only work with systems having GTK 2.4 and later. For systems such as those using Gnome it will have a 'native' look.</li>
</ul>
When the installer is run, a suitable frontend is automaticly choosen (in order: GTK+2, FLTK, ncurses). The install creator can decide which frontends should be included.

<h4>Installation Process</h4>
As been said, the user can control the installation process. In Nixstaller this is accomplished by the usage of 'installation screens'. There are a few predefined installation screens, that will let the user select destination paths, watch the installation progress, show an intro (optionally with graphics) etc. New installation screens can also be created manually. The install creator can place a range of different 'widgets' on newly created screens, such as inputfields, checkboxes and images.<br>
<br>
The creation of new screens, the installation process itself and configuration of the installer is all done via Lua scripts. Lua is a simple and easy to read scripting language. More info can be found on <a href="http://www.lua.org">the Lua homepage</a>. The Nixstaller manual also has an extensive Lua guide.<br>
<br>
Nixstaller has extended the Lua libraries with a whole range of new functions. These functions are used to communicate with the user's OS (Operating System), interact with the user, install desktop menu entries, extract installation files etc.

<h4>Installation Types</h4>
Nixstaller is flexible about how the software is installed. Examples of possible ways for installation are extracting files to a specified location and software compilation. Nixstaller also has a special method, called 'Package Mode', which can be used to let the user's package manager package and install the software.<br>
<br>
Package Mode is especially handy for software managing (uninstallation, upgrading). Currently the following package managers are supported: rpm, dpkg (deb), pacman (arch linux) and installpkg (slackware). If the installer is unable to use a package manager (or told not to), the installer will instead simply install the files and create an uninstallation script. When this script is called, it will verify all installed files with MD5 sums before they are removed. Besides package registration, Package Mode also supports basic dependency handling. Any dynamic libraries can be supplied with the installer. To let installed binaries know where to find the libraries, special wrapper scripts are created during installation that set up the right environment before launching the binary.

<h4>Other Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Creation of desktop menu entries (following the freedesktop standards).</li>
<li>Installers can be packed with gzip, bzip2 and lzma.</li>
<li>The (default) logo can easily be customized.</li>
<li>Usage of su and sudo, so that the user can grant the installer root access only when it needs too, instead of running it as the root user.</li>
<li>To safe space, similar frontend binaries are compared to each other and only the differences are packaged with the installer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Releases</h3>
The following features are planned or will be extended in future releases:
<ul>
<li>Language translations: A way to handle different encodings, possibly using gettext.</li>
<li>Dependency handling: This is a tricky item and needs more research. Possibilities for future releases:
<ul>
    <li>Better binary compatibility with existing libraries on the user's system (libc, libstdc++ but also Perl/Python modules).</li>
    <li>Easier way to include dependencies.</li>
    <li>Make dependencies optional, ie. seperate downloadable, check for existing dependencies etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Support for more package managers, such as BSD and Solaris package.</li>
<li>GUI tool for creating installers (see Nixstbuild).</li>
</ul>
This list is far from complete and it's very lickely that other features will be added to further releases.
